# The Case for Paranoia in the modern World

It is a sure thing by now, on most places of the internet there are certain institutions that want to know what we are up to.

On the common internet, let's use a search engine as example, we have advertisers that make digital fingerprints of us through our device specification, behavior and probably every other info accessible to them, just to show us better fitting ads, selling the data of to others.
This applies for services in general, most times when they are "free" then that is their motive. They'll try to maximise usetime and engagement, then continue to exploit the user as profitable as possible.

But there are also actors that do similar things not for a profit but for knowledge. E.g. nation states and their intelligence services. They don't want our ad profiles to advert but instead know who we connect to, what we are up to and various other things. Achieving that through spying on communication e.g. [Pegasus Spyware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_(spyware)), [NSA Prism (the thing Snowden leaked)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM), [AT&T Room 641A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_641A), etc..

And those are just some big known ones, I assume those in charge know their stuff and just as good how to hide it, what do we not know of?

So,
> What's the problem with it? They are just fighting terrorism.
somebody may say.

It's not that fighting terrorism is any bad. It's just when fighting terrorism has the price of the civilians privacy it may not be just as good. 

What is they foster all the data and at some point we get a totalitarian leader that decides "*now that we know which people have x political ideology, we should do y with them*".

There is no reason for a state, nor company, to collect all the personal data or conversations of us, but they won't stop, they have their own incentives. 

And that's where this blog comes in, I'll try to somehow help you guide through the system in place, how to still be safe, still protect what is there to protect.
I'm not there fully yet, and that's why I see myself in the position to talk about it, to go through all the stuff myself and talk about how it is developing, what one can do.

There are reasons to be paranoid, but that should not result in one doing nothing and just accepting it as a fact.
